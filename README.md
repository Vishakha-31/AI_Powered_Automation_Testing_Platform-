## 🚀 Core Features

This project is a comprehensive testing platform with a rich set of features:

#### **Black-Box Testing Suite**
* **AI Script Generation:** Generate complete Selenium test scripts by providing a URL and a high-level goal in plain English.
* **Natural Language Translation:** Write step-by-step test commands in simple English and have the AI translate them into the structured command format.
* **Multi-Language Voice Commands:** Execute tests hands-free by speaking commands in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and Marathi.
* **Visual Regression Testing:** Save "baseline" screenshots of your application and automatically detect any unintended visual changes on future test runs.

#### **White-Box Testing Suite**
* **AI Code Reviewer:** Paste Python code and get an instant analysis from the AI, which checks for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and best practice violations.
* **AI Unit Test Generator:** Automatically generate a complete `pytest` unit test suite for any given Python function.
* **AI Code Refactoring:** Clean up messy or inefficient code with a single click.

#### **Workflow & Reporting**
* **AI Bug Assistant:** When a test fails, the AI analyzes the error and provides a "Probable Cause" and a "Suggested Fix," dramatically reducing debugging time.
* **Persistent Test History:** All test runs are saved to your user account for later review.
* **Save & Re-run Test Suites:** Save complex test scripts as named "Test Suites" and re-run them anytime with a single click.
* **Professional PDF & Excel Reports:** Download beautifully formatted PDF or Excel reports for both black-box test runs and white-box code analysis.
* **CI/CD Deployment:** The application is fully configured for Continuous Integration and Deployment using a `Dockerfile` and is deployed on a live cloud platform.
